Django Generic Location
=======================

A address/location addon implemented with the django contenttype framework and 
geodjango.

Thus allows you to make any model "location" aware without having to modify 
the original models in any way.

It uses the geodjango PointField, so for the moment it depends on PostGIS.

It also includes a neat PointField widget for the django admin, 
that uses google maps for geoencoding the address and displaying the location
on a map.

Installation
============

Install and add to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py file:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'generic_locations',
    )

Run syncdb and collectstatic.

Usage
=====

To be able to add location information to your model, just import and add the Locationinline:


    class FooAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        ...
        ...
        inlines = [
          LocationInline,
        ]


    admin.site.register(Foo, FooAdmin)

#TODO: using Location in your views

Note: currently the javascript is made to work with django-grappelli.
Code is still alpha :)
